"""Masked regression losses (mae / mse / rmse).

These criteria operate on ``(prediction, target)`` tensors of shape
``(B, pred_len, N)`` — the pair ModernTSF's trainer passes to the
criterion — and accept an OPTIONAL ``targets_mask`` (1 = valid, 0 = ignore)
of the same shape.

When the mask is ``None`` (the default, and what the current 2-arg trainer
call produces) each loss is EXACTLY equivalent to the plain ``mae`` / ``mse``
/ ``rmse`` over all elements, so default training is unchanged.

Following the BasicTS convention, a provided mask is normalized by its own
mean (``mask = mask / mask.mean()``; ``nan_to_num``) so the loss stays
unbiased with respect to the number of valid entries.
