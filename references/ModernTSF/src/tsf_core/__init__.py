"""TSF-Core — the contract layer shared by ModernTSF (producer) and TSEval (consumer).

This is a dependency-light pydantic package (pydantic + stdlib only). It defines
the three contract models — :class:`DatasetSpec`, :class:`RunRecord`,
:class:`SubmissionReport` — and exports them to JSON Schema, which is the *only*
artifact TSEval reads. Do not import ``benchmark`` / ``data`` / ``models`` /
``torch`` / ``numpy`` / ``datasets`` from here: that boundary is what keeps the
consumer side free of the ML stack.
