"""Shared constants for the TSF-Core contract layer.

This module is the single source of truth for the metric / profile field names
and the task-mode / track vocabularies used across DatasetSpec, RunRecord and
SubmissionReport. The metric and profile tuples are kept byte-for-byte aligned
with their ModernTSF producers so that records can be assembled with zero
key translation:

- ``METRIC_NAMES``  ↔ ``benchmark.evaluation.metrics.collect_metrics`` keys
- ``PROFILE_FIELDS`` ↔ ``benchmark.evaluation.profile.parse_profile_report`` keys

TSF-Core depends only on ``pydantic`` + the Python standard library. It must
never import ``benchmark`` / ``data`` / ``models`` / ``torch`` / ``numpy`` /
``datasets`` — that boundary is what lets TSEval consume the exported JSON
Schema without pulling the ML stack.
