# HimNet

HimNet (Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network) is a spatiotemporal learning model designed for node-structured or graph-structured data. It captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity by learning spatial and temporal embeddings as a clustering process, then derives location- and time-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools using a hierarchical meta-graph GRU encoder-decoder with an adaptively learned graph topology.

## Abstract
Spatiotemporal time series forecasting plays a key role in a wide range of real-world applications. While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.
