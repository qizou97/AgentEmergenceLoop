# SymTime

SymTime is a pre-trained time-series foundation model that leverages synthetic series-symbol data to overcome data scarcity and imbalance in time-series analysis. Drawing on complex dynamic system theories, it generates unlimited high-quality time-series data paired with symbolic expressions, then pre-trains a Transformer-based series encoder jointly with a symbol encoder (built on a pre-trained LLM) through masked time-series modelling and masked language modelling. The resulting representations are fine-tuned for downstream forecasting tasks, serving the standard multivariate time-series forecasting setting.

## Abstract
Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime.
